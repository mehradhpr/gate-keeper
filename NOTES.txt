WEB API Notes:
- Web APIs handle http requests and responses while following the http protocol to manage the communication between
    the client and the server

1- Node.js http module
2- Express.js
2- Next.js

- NextResponse and NextRequest are used for the new App router
- NextAPIResponse and NextAPIRequest are used for the old pages router
- These Web Apis are simply an extension to the standard web APIs of Request and Response used in Node

To trigger the middleware, put middleware.ts inside of src, when you use App router
